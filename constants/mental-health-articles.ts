          content: "The therapeutic relationship is crucial to success. Don't hesitate to 'shop around' until you find the right fit. Consider factors like specialization, approach (CBT, psychodynamic, etc.), availability, and whether you feel comfortable with them. Many therapists offer free consultations. Trust your instincts—if it doesn't feel right, keep looking."
